# python_cpp_example
This repository contains an example Python module which wraps C++ code. The code presented here was designed to meet four requirements:

1. Python bindings for C++ code (using pybind11).
2. Unit tests for C++ code (using Catch).
3. Unit tests for Python code (using unittest).
4. A setuptools setup.py script for building, installation, and testing.
